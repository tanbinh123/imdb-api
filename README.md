## Motivation

My teacher signed me on a project when I was a junior programmer.

I had to make a Social platform bot (like Telegram or Discord bots) where users could search for Movies and TV Series, look up their detail, create playlists, and share them with others.

After smashing my head onto the keyboard for almost two weeks and a half, I finally found a free IMDb API, which stopped working after a while.

Back in the day, I didn't know how to integrate my application to the IMDb website properly, so sadly, I had to abandon the project.

But now, when I look back at it after many years, I can imagine how hard it could be if someone tries to develop an application sightly or even heavily dependent on the IMDb website.

There are so many reverse-engineered, untrustworthy platforms out there that would take your money in exchange for providing an unstable API.

So I thought of developing a microservice that developers could use in the software they're trying to create.

I didn't profoundly plan how I would create such an application.

But because I was motivated, I created its repository and will slowly work on building small chunks of it, starting from the documentation and overall expectations.

Side note:

I came from having six years of TypeScript experience to Golang, and this project is one of my early projects using this language.

I chose it because it is more performant and efficient and can compile the packages and their dependencies into a single executable binary.

I'm not confident about my coding approaches, maybe I'm stuck with JS strategies in my head, but I'm excited about how it will end up.

Feel free to join my journey by contributing to this project.
